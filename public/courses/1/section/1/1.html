<h1>THE NEW VERSION OF THE COURSE IS HERE!</h1>
<h2>WELCOME TO THE NEW VERSION OF THE COURSE!</h2>
<p>Hey everyone! On October 12th 2020, I launched a complete overhaul of this course with over 500 new videos. If you
  are seeing this message, you are experiencing this new version of the course in its very early days. I will remove
  this lecture after the first couple of weeks after launching.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that this is the largest, most complex course I have ever launched on Udemy and that there will
  likely be some minor bugs and kinks that need to work out. I need your help in identifying those issues! I thank you
  in advance! Please enjoy the brand new version of this course</p>
